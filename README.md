*Data Science in Production: Building Scalable Model Pipelines with Python*<br />
By Ben Weber

The original repository located at [bgweber/DS_Production](https://github.com/bgweber/DS_Production) is the companion repository for the book [Data Science in Production: Building Scalable Model Pipelines with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Production-Building-Pipelines-ebook/dp/B083H2YWP4). My fork contains code that updates Ben's. For instance, the book uses `TensorFlow` 1 whereas I would like to use `TensorFlow` 2.
